        <p>Been using Windows 8 for a little over 3 weeks now.</p>
<p>I have to say, that this OS has been easier to use and has had less problems than Windows 7. I’ve already become accustomed to the workflows and cannot really find many faults (besides the fact that it’s not *nix based).</p>
<p>That being said, I have not used any metro applications and will probably not use any metro applications for the foreseeable future. I do not believe metro is a viable direction for desktops.</p>
<p>However, it’s very easy to forget that Windows 8 even has metro applications and just use the operating system like previous versions of Windows would be used. With the exception of the start menu, the Desktop mode in Windows 8 is nearly identicial to Windows 7. Being one that has not used the start menu in many years, I do not see this as a fault or issue.</p>
<p>I will review Windows 8, like I would review any Linux distribution.</p>
<h3 id="Performance-5-5"><a href="#Performance-5-5" class="headerlink" title="Performance (5/5)"></a>Performance (5/5)</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong><br>The fastest desktop operating system I have ever used.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong><br>N/A</p>
<h3 id="Stability-5-5"><a href="#Stability-5-5" class="headerlink" title="Stability (5/5)"></a>Stability (5/5)</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong><br>The most stable operating system I have ever used. Not a single problem has occurred since the installation on my desktop (my laptop is another story though).</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong><br>N/A</p>
<h3 id="Packaging-5-5"><a href="#Packaging-5-5" class="headerlink" title="Packaging (5/5)"></a>Packaging (5/5)</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong><br>This is where most Linux distributions fall flat on their face. I don’t have this problem on Windows. For unix applications, I have installed Gnutils, Cygwin and Mingw. This has covered all my needs so far and I haven’t found a reason to use a full Linux installation. If I do need a full installation, then I can setup a headless virtualbox with a very light weight Arch Linux install and SSH into it.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong><br>N/A</p>
<h3 id="Installation-4-5"><a href="#Installation-4-5" class="headerlink" title="Installation (4/5)"></a>Installation (4/5)</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong><br>Windows 8 has the same installation procedure that Windows 7 has. It’s a decent installer and gets out of the way. The installer has a far better UI and procedure than Ubuntu or Fedora.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong><br>It deletes the MBR and there’s no easy way to stop that from happening.</p>
<p><strong>UI (3/5):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<div class="tab">The polish and attention to detail has not been seen before in other versions of Windows. The OS has some decent keyboard shortcuts too. I find that metro can be largely ignored. The start screen is simply that, a start screen. It functions better and is faster than the old start menu. It makes more sense.</div>

<p><strong>Cons</strong><br>There is the jarring effect of having metro and the classical desktop. Windows has never been strong in the UI department (but this is an improvement over Windows 7).</p>
<h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Windows 8 is the best desktop operating system I have ever used. I’d also go as far to say it’s the best. There is a lot FUD being spread around about Windows 8, but it doesn’t really hold up.</p>
<p>There’s no certainty that Microsoft can keep this up though, but I hope they continue to make improvements to the classical desktop and keep it alive. Metro doesn’t cut it for daily desktop usage.</p>

        <p>After upgrading to Windows 8, I noticed some stability issues with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/juno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Juno</a>. Many of the problems were so bad that they made Juno completely unusable on my installation.</p>
<p>While downloading the older version of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/indigo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse (Indigo)</a>, I decided to also give <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Idea Intelij</a>&nbsp;community edition a try.</p>
<h2 id="Setup-the-project"><a href="#Setup-the-project" class="headerlink" title="Setup the project"></a>Setup the project</h2><p>Setting up the project is really easy with the “play” command.</p>
<p>Simply add the play framework to your $PATH or %PATH% (as you probably already have) and type: <code>play idea</code><br>in your project folder. This should create an Intelij project that you can later import.</p>
<h3 id="Download-Intelij"><a href="#Download-Intelij" class="headerlink" title="Download Intelij"></a>Download Intelij</h3><p>Download the community edition of Intelij from here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</a></p>
<h2 id="Setup-Scala-Support"><a href="#Setup-Scala-Support" class="headerlink" title="Setup Scala Support"></a>Setup Scala Support</h2><h3 id="Scala-Plugin"><a href="#Scala-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Scala Plugin"></a>Scala Plugin</h3><p>The Scala plugin can be installed by clicking&nbsp;<em>File-&gt;Settings-&gt;Plugins-&gt;”Browse Repositories…”.</em>&nbsp;After the installation of this plugin, everything should be ready for developing your Play 2.0 Scala application.</p>
<h3 id="Play-2-0-Plugin-Not-recommended"><a href="#Play-2-0-Plugin-Not-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Play 2.0 Plugin (Not recommended)"></a>Play 2.0 Plugin (Not recommended)</h3><p>There is a Play 2.0 plugin for Intelij that has nightly builds here:</p>
<p><a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/SCA/Play+2.0+plugin+Nightly+Builds+for+Leda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/SCA/Play+2.0+plugin+Nightly+Builds+for+Leda</a> </p>
<p>It is still in the early stages of development.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-noticed"><a href="#What-I-noticed" class="headerlink" title="What I noticed"></a>What I noticed</h2><p>I noticed the Scala support is very stable and auto complete works more often than not. The IDE seems a lot more cohesive and easier to use than Eclipse. The UI is well thought out.</p>
<p>Performance on my desktop machine is where Intelij is not the best. I changed some of the theming options and disabled unneeded plugins. Fortunately that fixed many of the performance issues, but it’s not as fast as Eclipse Juno. This is not a big deal though, because the rest of the IDE makes up for it.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m happy with Intelij and will begin to consider using it more often in other projects.</p>

        <p>Server based Linux distributions are simply extraordinary. They’re performant, reliable, fault tolerant and support a large variety of applications. Features of the operating systems are engineered to make sense for large scale deployments. Everything from the setup of the file system to the way services are handled makes sense for a server. Organizations rarely see limitations with their Linux distributions, instead they see a powerful and malleable operating system that suites the needs of modern networks and service architectures.</p>
<p>Distributions like Red Hat, Suse Enterprise (and in some cases Debian) make it very easy for organizations to have confidence in the software they run and to be sure that security updates will come in on time. They’re not too worried about having to compile software they do not find in the package manager from scratch. They’re probably also not worried that many of the packages in the manager are a few months or years out of date. It doesn’t matter. They simply require tried and tested software that they know will  host their services.</p>
<p>The server environment has had a ton of investment over the years and is thoroughly engineered to meet the demands of the enterprise. The success of the Linux server is no mishap. It is properly engineered, purely deliberate and fully functional.</p>
<p>What about the Linux desktop? Well one could argue that with the advent of Windows 7 that Linux desktop distributions have been less and less relevant. On the other hand one could also argue that with Windows 8 they will be more relevant than before.</p>
<p>Why has the Linux desktop failed while the server has been so successful? The reasons are very numerous and very complicated.&nbsp;There is no single issue that amounts to the trouble that is the Linux desktop. There are only minor issues that all add up to be a sum greater than their individual parts.</p>
<p>That is except for the installation of software. In no other area do Linux desktop distributions have more trouble (gaming is another post in its own right).&nbsp;For example. Imagine a wireless driver that has a regression from kernel release 2.6.32 to 3.0.0 and stops functioning (this problem was faced by my most recent laptop.) That means that the average user that does not want to compile a kernel can only install a distribution that is old enough to support 2.6.31.</p>
<p>Why can’t a Linux distribution with kernel 3.0.0, also be able to support the kernel from a previous release? And pull it from an older repository? Why can’t packages know which kernel they support? Well, the reason is that package maintainers usually do not know what the oldest kernel version is that a package supports (unless it’s a high profile package such as glibc, gcc, xorg,  drivers, etc.)</p>
<p>Actually most applications rarely rely on kernel versions. Debian’s dpkg is an example of a program that actually does rely on being compiled against specific kernel versions to access superior functionality. This is done for performance, but very few user land applications actually do this. On a given system, only a handful of packages require a kernel more recent than x.x.5 releases behind.</p>
<p>Why can’t users just have the best of both worlds and install two different versions of dpkg, so they use each kernel? You can argue about a distribution supporting multiple versions of a kernel and its merits, along with the technical difficulty of such a proposition. It’s a very difficult matter and distributions are usually not in the business of spending time doing this. They’re usually too busy simply packaging and integrating software for the next release to have any time or resources for small gains.</p>
<p>But what about multiple versions of Mozilla Firefox? Multiple versions of GCC? Why is this a problem? What if a user needs both GCC 4.2 and 4.7? Why does a package maintainer have to split them apart for the user? What if the distribution doesn’t have both versions? What if the user does not want to compile GCC from scratch. Doesn’t the process of having to compile an application  defeat the point of having an operating system? Does a user have an operating system to simply spend the majority of their time understanding compiler errors and waiting for infamously long C++ compile times?</p>
<p>What about when a user goes to a website and they want to install an application, but they find that their distribution does not support the versions of dependencies required. They have to upgrade their distribution. Why can the distribution not have both the new versions of the libraries and the previous versions? Windows does this fine.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely jarring to go from a website where I can see all the information on an application, switch to the package manager and find that the application is not available. Forcing the user into a jailed sandbox, where they rely on the distribution for software is the same as having an app store for your operating system. There is little to no difference. Users  have little control over the versions of software and have a hard time installing software from sources that are external to their standard repositories.</p>
<p>It’s simply a system that cannot scale. Developers cannot package their software for multiple distributions and package maintainers simply cannot package all the world’s Linux applications. Users are locked into the tiny world that is their Linux distribution. Even Ubuntu is not perfect and versions differ and developers stop supporting software and package maintainers stop packaging software. There’s too much human effort being thrown at a problem that shouldn’t exist. It’s simply wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>Linux on the desktop is simply a muscle car that’s burning and shredding its wheels, but it is going no where. It hasn’t solved the core problem of a desktop operating system. People do not simply select operating systems for their desktop environments or because they look good on tablets. They select them for the applications they run.</p>
<p>An operating system’s only purpose is to run applications. This should be the primary focus of the Linux desktop.</p>

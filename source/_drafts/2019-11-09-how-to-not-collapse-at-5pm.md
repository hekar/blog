How to not collapse at 5PM

Lately I've had a lot of people ask me exactly what I do for work. For the longest time I had difficulty in answering this question. Recently I've found an analogy. Programming is like writing a book.

Sometimes there's difficulty in explaining to new programmers why we need to write programs that are easy to understand. Some newer developers will insist that it is enough that the computer understands their code.

Programs, like books differ in length and sometimes come in multiple volumes, but they share much in common with the code we write for computers. The code we write for computers is not simply meant for the computer, but for other developers. People need to understand code being executed if they are to correctly perform modifications.

Similar to how books are separated into pages, paragraphs and sentences. Programs are separated into files, functions and lines.

Computers will jump between functions and lines based on the conditionals written at the programmers discretion. Some functions are executed repeatedly, while others rarely. Some lines are expensive, while others cheap. Optimizing for the computers makes sense.

But ensuring readability for other programmers is another essential portion of development. Looking at a function one should immediately understand its purpose and reason for existence. Every function must have a reason for being there. Functions should have a simple, yet singular purpose that can be summarized in a sentence.

Sometimes code is complicated. Optimization for the computer can be more important than readability. But these programs are the exception; not the norm. The majority of products benefits from readability over optimization. Code is read again and again. Regardless of what we think, most programs that enter production will be altered. Changes will be made and ensuring existing behavior matches requirements will have to done well after the testing phase.

Therefore we should focus on writing code is that is easy to read. Just as reading a difficult novel is tiring, reading difficult code can be even more exhausting.

To ensure readability, we should look at the modules, classes, functions and lines we write.

For instance, functions should ideally adhere to:

1. The smaller the better
2. A function should only do one thing
3. Avoid nested control structures
4. The less arguments the better
5. Avoid side effects
6. Clearly define errors and separate from valid results

Functions being such an integral part of creating applications, should have effort put in to ensure the sum of all parts result in quality.

Reading difficult code can be mentally taxing. Eight hours of reading unnecessarily convoluted code can so exhausting that it causes programmers to stop programming all together when they get home. Poorly written code adds no value. Difficult code sometimes comes only of poor design and provides no benefits. It makes development and code reviews a chore, creates long hours and ultimately makes developers leave for better pastures.

Always ask your coworkers how they feel reading your code. Just as you'd ask an editor to proofread your work. Your coworkers are both your audience and proofreaders. Review your code before the review. Know that your coworkers'  opinions matter and discussion should be done from the point of working as a team to create the highest quality applications. Because code that's easy to read is easier to understand. And easier to understand code means it's easier to extend and expand your business.

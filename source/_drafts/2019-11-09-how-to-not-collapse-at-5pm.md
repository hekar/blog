How to not collapse at 5PM

Lately I've had a lot of people ask me exactly what I do for work. For the longest time I've had difficulty answering this question, but recently I've found an analogy. Programming is like writing a book.

Sometimes there's difficulty in explaining to new programmers why we need to write programs that are easy to understand. Some newer developers will insist that the computer understands their code.

Programs, like books differ in length. They sometimes come in multiple volumes, but they share much in common with the code we write for computers. The code we write for computers is not simply meant for the computer, but for other developers.

Similar to how books are separated into pages, paragraphs and sentences. Programs are separated into files, functions and lines.

Computers will jump between functions and lines based on the conditionals written at the programmers discretion. Some functions execute repeatedly, while others rarely. Some lines are expensive, while others cheap. Optimizing for the computers makes sense.

But ensuring readability for other programmers is an essential portion of development. Looking at a function it'd make sense that one immediately understand its purpose and reason for being there. Every function must have a reason for existence. It should be simple, singular purpose and be summarizable in a sentence.

Sometimes code is complicated. Optimization for the computer can be more important than readability. But these programs are the exception; not the norm. The majority of products benefits from readability over optimization. Regardless of what we initially believe, most programs that enter production will be altered. Changes will be made and ensuring existing behavior matches requirements will have to done well after the testing phase.

Therefore we should focus on writing code that is easy to read. Just as reading a difficult novel is tiring, reading difficult code can be just as exhausting.

To ensure readability, we should look at the modules, classes, functions and lines we write.

For instance, functions should ideally adhere to:

1. The smaller the better
2. A function should only do one thing
3. Avoid nested control structures
4. The less arguments the better
5. Avoid side effects
6. Clearly define errors and separate from valid results

Functions being such an integral part of creating applications, should have effort put in to ensure the sum of all parts result in quality.

Writers put time to ensuring their books are joyful to read. Why don't programmers put time into at least ensuring their coworkers are not burdened by their source?

Because reading difficult code can be mentally taxing. Eight hours of reading unnecessarily convoluted code can so exhausting that it causes programmers to stop programming all together when they get home. Learning nothing new after hours. Worse yet, poorly implemented code adds no value. Sometimes coming only of poor design and incorrect assumptions. Poor code makes modification and code reviews a chore, creates long hours and ultimately burns developers out.

Always ask your coworkers how they feel reading your code. Just as you'd ask an editor before publishing your work. Your coworkers are both your audience and proofreaders. Put your best foot forward. Know that your coworkers' time and opinion matter. Therefore discussion should be done from the point of working as a team. Because code that's geared towards the reader can be easier to understand. And easier to understand code means it's easier to extend and expand your business.

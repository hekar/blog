title: Coding is writing

Recently a friend asked what I do for a living. For the longest time I'd had difficulty answering this question. Somehow in that moment it all came together. An analogy. Programming is like writing.

Libraries like textbooks with numbered sections and a detailed index in the back.
Functions like text referenced by smaller numbered sections.
Instructions like lines of text.

Professional programming differs slightly. Professional programmers normally work together on the same pieces of text. Stitching many volumes of text together through references. These programmers do both the authorship and final edits.

As authors, we attempt to build something both the computer and other readers can reasonably grasp in an economic timeframe. There being a clear emphasis on ensuring the instructions written match our original intent. Ambiguity cannot be deciphered by the computer. Instructions need to be conveniently understood by other programmers, but specific enough for the computer executing them. From the computer's perspective, there is no ambiguity, instructions must be exact.

During pull requests as reviewers, we work as editors. Ensuring correctness. Looking for ways to improve the work. Scanning to confirm text is malleable enough for future additions or modifications. Finally confirming that the produced work matches its original intent. The ease of readability of the author's contribution determines how smoothly the pull request will be reviewed. The smaller the better. Code is written in units, not volumes.

Books are normally a single publication that are released and never structurally altered afterward. Programs differ in that we are constantly making alterations. Even years after the initial release. Partially because for a program to be written in a time effective manner, it must reference third-party libraries that contain blocks of existing text. Why write instructions twice, when they can be referenced. 

Since externally referenced instructions must be updated to support new programs, older programs must also be updated for correct usage. Tangentially users demand addition, removal or modification of functionality.

All of these instructions create a large nonlinear script. The computer reads the script with multiple cursors. Sometimes executing multiple at the same time. Sometimes only one at a time. Using interrupts to change the currently active cursor. Single blocks of instructions can be repeated billions of times as the cursors jump back to previously executed locations again and again.

Much of the difficulty in reading arises from the nonlinear nature of the script. Depending on the instructions, programs will tell the reader, whether the computer or another programmer to jump to another portion of its instructions. Sometimes these instructions are in the same program or in another library entirely. Programmers call this type of nonlinear execution "branching". The goal of the programmer is to make it easier for a reader to understand not only instructions, but references to instructions.

Programmers are authors. Writing primarily for each other to ensure that even with the nonlinear nature and difficulty presented by it, we still have a work that can be read. If not with enjoyment, then with the least pain possible.

Just as reading a difficult novel is exhausting, difficult code can be just as exhausting.

Since writing consists of clarity of thought, planning and general skill it makes sense that major tech companies have shifted their interview practices to algorithm and data structure based questions. Organizations are looking for developers with the ability to think and communicate clearly. Preferably as fast as possible. Developer forums and news channels talk about the latest languages and frameworks, but many do not talk of this essential skill.

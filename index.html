Code coverage can be a useful heuristic for determining whether code is adequately executed by a given set of unit tests.

Tooling that produces code coverage will never be able to inform you how well your assertions are executed or if the given execution is necessary, but they will you an about whether a portion of code is covered by tests at all.

From 2005 to 2017, I hadn't been able to stick to a single installation of any Linux Desktop Distribution. Whether it was Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, Mepis or any of the many Linux distributions I switched between. Even Windows would periodically be installed onto one of many computers.

It took until 2017 for me to settle. On OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Why did it take so long? I would argue that it was not entirely my fault. That most Linux distributions were not stable enough. Until recently there'd been the promise of an easy to use, yet stable and up to date distribution that'd never came to fruition.

In the past few months, I have noticed that `npm link` and scoped packages have gone underused by my colleagues.
The `npm link` command is essential for quick development. And if you're building private packages inside an organization, scoped packages can make managing and installing packages much simpler.

Before we can do anything, we need a scoped package. Fortunately, it's as simple as naming the package in the following format: `@<scope>/<package>`.

Getting a Thinkpad T520â€™s NVIDIA Quadro video card working with OpenSUSE 13.2 or other modern distributions does not have to be the hard.

Many modern laptops only support video output (DVI, HDMI, Display Port) on the dedicated GPU. Fortunately, on the T520, we can easily configure Linux to use the NVIDIA video card as the primary card. Avoiding any screen tearing or other issues you're traditionally notice from the video output being copied between the integrated and dedicated graphics processors.

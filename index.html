        <p>This post is a quick tutorial on how to create an <a href="https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-vue</a> application with the <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vuetify</a> library. The resulting application will bundles into Windows, macOS and Linux binaries.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The included version of <a href="https://electronjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron</a> with <a href="https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-vue</a> is rather dated. There are defects in the version of electron shipped with electron-vue. Upgrading the version of electron is a difficult undertaking and may not be worthwhile. The end of this post contains links to various resources that can provide more update to date environments. Updating electron can be important if you are building a security sensitive application or using the application to browse external websites.</p>

<p>The results of the build process will be visible in <code>./build/</code> and will depend on your platform. Cross platform compilation is not supported, so you will need the target operating system to compile that release.</p>
<p>Supported target formats are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All platforms:</strong> 7z, zip, tar.xz, tar.lz, tar.gz, tar.bz2, dir (unpacked directory).</p>
<p><strong>macOS:</strong> dmg, pkg, mas, mas-dev.</p>
<p><strong>Linux:</strong> AppImage, snap, debian package (deb), rpm, freebsd, pacman, p5p, apk.</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong> nsis (Installer), nsis-web (Web installer), portable (portable app without installation), AppX (Windows Store), Squirrel.Windows.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.electron.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-builder</a> documentation</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Getting started with electron-vue and vuetify is fairly simple, though there are issues that require workarounds. Changes such as adding the vuetify module to the <code>whitelist</code> collection are easy to miss. <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/electron-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-vue</a> is a little out of date, so in a follow up post, I will go over how to configure electron, <a href="https://www.electron.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-builder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vue</a> and <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vuetify</a> from scratch. I will also go over <a href="https://github.com/michalzaq12/electron-nuxt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-nuxt</a> which is a project looking to replace <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/electron-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-vue</a>.</p>
<p>For now, <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/electron-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron-vue</a> is still a great project and highly recommended for users that wish to quickly create desktop applications with <a href="https://electronjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vue</a> and <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vuetify</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_\(game_engine\" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source SDK</a>#Source_SDK) is a fork of Valve’s internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perforce</a> repository containing the application code they use to build Valve’s games based on the Source 1 engine. Games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Source" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Counter Strike: Source</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2</a>.</p>
<p>The SDK <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Github</a> is primarily based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-life 2</a>, while other games are removed from the repository before they are exported to Github.</p>
<p>Link to Github: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/</a></p>
<p>The Source SDK is comprised of multiple projects that are shared libraries which are referenced by a proprietary engine created by Valve. The Engine and some of its surrounding tools are not open source and while source code can be found on the internet, usage is not legal and is covered under both copyright and DMCA.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Source SDK license</a> makes it clear that the shared libraries are the property of Valve and while they may be freely used, there are some limitations that make them different from typical GPL and BSD licenses that we have become accustomed to. Namely that the application created cannot be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<h3 id="Why-would-you-want-to-use-the-Source-SDK"><a href="#Why-would-you-want-to-use-the-Source-SDK" class="headerlink" title="Why would you want to use the Source SDK?"></a>Why would you want to use the Source SDK?</h3><p>The Source SDK is rather interesting, because there quite a few successful commercial games based on the platform. The platform is rather rich in features, though it may not be the most intuitive platform to use. The tooling and artwork pipeline lacks in areas that make it difficult for an artist to use. The artistic pipeline is primarily centered around proprietary file formats designed specifically for the Source Engine and command-line utilities that must be used to cover files between supported non-commercial formats and Valve’s proprietary Source Engine formats.</p>
<p>Overall, the Source SDK can be interesting, because it is based on Half-life 2 and contains a fully featured version of Half-life 2 within it. This can give a basis for building a prototype or game top of the existing Half-life 2 series without needing to create everything from scratch. Of course Source is used to create many other games and contains abstractions that make it easy to move away from the look and feel of Half-life. Adding player functionality, weapons and game entities is completely within the scope of creating a game based on the Source SDK.</p>
<h3 id="Compiling-on-Linux"><a href="#Compiling-on-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Compiling on Linux"></a>Compiling on Linux</h3><p>Now, because much of the Source SDK and the engine are proprietary. There is not much of a booming open source community as one would expect with some of this caliber of quality. Namely, because of a lack of updates, communication and being partially limited due its proprietary nature.</p>
<p>The Source Engine and SDK support Windows, macOS and Linux, but due to its closed sourced libraries compilation can be rather tricky. In this post I will show the easiest way to get started compiling the Source SDK on Linux.</p>
<p>The easiest way to compile the Source SDK on Linux is to use <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> and an image of <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu 14.04</a>. The reasoning is because the proprietary libraries that the SDK must be linked against were built using the shared libraries and version of GCC found in Ubuntu 14.04.</p>

<h3 id="Other-Tooling-on-Linux"><a href="#Other-Tooling-on-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Other Tooling on Linux"></a>Other Tooling on Linux</h3><p>Much of the Source SDK tooling is created for Windows only and does not execute on macOS or Linux. The solution is rather typical. Use Wine which supports most Source SDK tools rather reliably.</p>
<p>For model editing, the native version of <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender 2.8x</a> can <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Blender_Source_Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be used</a> with the <a href="http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender Source Tools</a>.</p>
<p>For mapping the included <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hammer</a> can be used] by installing the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source Base 2013 Single Player</a> installed with the Windows compatibility layer. Launch <code>Hammer.exe</code> using wine from the bin directory.</p>
<p>For texture compilation, the <a href>tga2vtf.exe</a> command-line application can be used via Wine.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Using the Source SDK on Linux is feasible, although rather time consuming and sometimes unintuitive. It is more difficult to extend the platform due to the closed source nature. Had the Engine and SDK been fully open source and developed as an open source project in tandem with the surrounding community there would be a remarkable improvement in productivity and community support. Hopefully future versions of the Source 2 Engine will be developed directly on Github with developers allowing for complete open usage of their game engine.</p>
<p>Never the less, anyone interested in game development should take a look at the Source SDK if only for a view into how commercial games were developed in past. The Source SDK is a piece of history in game engine and tool development that has many lessons to offer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bryan+cantrill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryan Cantrill</a> is one of my favorite presenters, so I was excited to see that he’d be giving a keynote at QCon. For a long time, computer enthuasaists have been talking about the end of Moore’s law and what it means for computing. What Cantrill explains is that Moore’s law is close to ending, it’s not the end of the world, but developers aren’t going to get the “free” performance increases we’ve seen in the past.</p>
<p>Bryan references three “laws” in his talk.</p>
<p>The laws referenced are Dennard Scaling, Moore’s Law and Amdahl’s Law.</p>
<p>What Bryan argues is that Moore’s Law is nearing its end and transistor sizes below 7nm are going to be more expensive and yield less benefits going forward. Programmers have become accustomed to computers becoming faster and cheaper every year, but this may no longer be the case.</p>
<p>I will quickly go over the three laws referenced by Cantrill in his talk.</p>
<h3 id="Dennard-Scaling"><a href="#Dennard-Scaling" class="headerlink" title="Dennard Scaling"></a>Dennard Scaling</h3><p>From Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki/Dennard_scaling</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling, is a scaling law based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert H. Dennard, after whom it is named. Originally formulated for MOSFETs, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant, so that the power use stays in proportion with area; both voltage and current scale (downward) with length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dennard scaling meant that processors could go faster simply by increasing the frequency. From 100Mhz to 2GHz to 3GHz and so on. Frequency increases broke down somewhere in 2005 - 2007, due to “current leakage” which caused increased chip heat and power consumption. Afterwards, chip manufacturers began adding additional cores, instead of optimizing for increased frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="Moore’s-Law"><a href="#Moore’s-Law" class="headerlink" title="Moore’s Law"></a>Moore’s Law</h3><p>From Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki/Moores_law</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moore’s law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and CEO of Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975 looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.4%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Dennard’s Scaling, the definition of Moore’s Law has less of a consenus. People are still debating exactly what the law covers. Cantrill defines Moore’s Law a differently from the summary on Wikipedia. He uses references found in various interviews, articles and books to piece together what he thinks Moore’s Law means.</p>
<p>From his <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/no-moore-left-to-give-enterprise-computing-after-moores-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…for many years, Moore’s Law could be inferred to the doublings of density, speed and economics…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moore’s Law accounts for more than the doubling of density, which could theoritically be achieved at the cost of economics (moving to a more expensive material) or speed.</p>
<p>Cantrill argues that processors had become higher density, while also becoming cheaper for both manufacturers and consumers. This changed around 2015 when processors began becoming more expensive with each additional generation, even though transistor nodes had shrunk in size.</p>
<h3 id="Amdahl’s-Law"><a href="#Amdahl’s-Law" class="headerlink" title="Amdahl’s Law"></a>Amdahl’s Law</h3><p>From Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki/Amdahls_law</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer architecture, Amdahl’s law (or Amdahl’s argument[1]) is a formula which gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. It is named after computer scientist Gene Amdahl, and was presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting of the “laws” is “Amdahl’s Law” which refers to parallelism and the potiential speed improvements that can be gained by increasing core counts for a particular application.</p>
<p>Amdahl’s refers to the speedup that can be expected from parallel computations as limited by the sequentional portion of the application. Applications can be divided into sequential and parallel portions, of which _P_ defines the percentage of the application that executes in parallel.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia image shows the potential speedup with each additional core. The lines denote differing values for _P_ (50%, 75%, 90% and 95%).<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/1280px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/1280px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png"></p>
<p>The graph shows that an application with a 50% parallelized portion (such as Google Chrome) will not benefit from anymore than 16 processor cores. An application with 90% parallization will not benefit from more than 512 processor cores.</p>
<p>There’s an informative video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBOU23L720&amp;t=442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coreteks</a> titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBOU23L720&amp;t=442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hardware trends: How many cores do we need?!</a> where he succinctly explains Amdahl’s law and how it relates to CPUs, GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs. In the video he states that GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs are not necessarily solutions to CPU performance issues as they all suffer from Amdahl’s law. Once a commonly performed tasks have a specialized ASIC created, there is not much that can be done beyond the hardware optimization work we’ve seen in the past. Transistor size reductions providing ~40% performance improvements every two years will no longer be the case. And tasks which cannot be fully parallelized will not benefit from being executed across many cores. Hence software developers will have to become more accustomed to optimizing their applications again.</p>
<h3 id="Microservices"><a href="#Microservices" class="headerlink" title="Microservices"></a>Microservices</h3><p>One consequence of Moore’s Law ending is the proliferation of computing across many devices and computers. CPU computation will become distributed and closer to where it is needed. This is seen in the proliferation of IoT applications we have been seeing.</p>
<p>Part of this has been the push towards microservices. Microservice oriented architectures have the potential to suffer from the same constraints around scaling as Amdahl’s law.</p>
<p>Though data is normally partitioned (ideally by more than the tenant), sometimes there’s ends up being shared resources where data must be processed sequentially. These portions of the application can be rather difficult to scale.</p>
<p>What percentage of a user’s request can be parallized in a distributed system? Are there transactions that need to occur? What about costly shared infrastructure such as queues or event streams?</p>
<p>If a request must go through a shared linear queue in a distributed system, this may limit how effective simply scaling the components around the queue will be.</p>
<p>When architecting distributed systems, careful consideration must be made about shared state if one wants to effectively understand how their system will scale. Simply increasing the number of web servers one has when their file storage is the bottleneck is not effective and can be counter productive.</p>
<h3 id="Future-technologies"><a href="#Future-technologies" class="headerlink" title="Future technologies"></a>Future technologies</h3><p>There are many technologies in the pipeline of chip manufacturers including 2.5D and 3D packaging which allow for the addition of memory, ASICs, GPUs and other chiplets to be included on processor dies. By including these chiplets on processor dies, the amount of energy and time required to transfer data can be reduced. Making previously high latency tasks feasible in high performance computing.</p>
<p>Other technologies include asymethic processing cores, where CPU cores are designed for different tasks. One core may be designed for high performance single threaded applications such as web browsers, while other cores will be designed for parallizable vector computables used by graphics or video editing applications.</p>
<p>There are still improvements that can be made at the power and IPC level, but they will require changes in software and operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The take away from Cantrill’s presentation is that computers aren’t going to get <em>much</em> faster <strong><em>and</em></strong> cheaper from here. We will see some improvements in the amount of cores packed into a machine, but this may come at the cost of heat, price and memory latency.</p>
<p>The real outcome is going to be the proliferation of more computers being used in areas we previously did not expect and larger distributed systems being built across slower commodity hardware.</p>

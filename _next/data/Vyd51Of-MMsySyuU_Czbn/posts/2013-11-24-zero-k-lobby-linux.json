The game is called Zero-K, is freely avaliable and open source. While the game runs very well under Windows, I have experienced quite a few issues under Linux.</p>\n<p>Recently, the game had stopped working altogether and I had been unsure of why.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After spending much time troubleshooting through \"strace\", I had began to suspect that the problem lay in the Lobby frontend for the game, rather than the game itself.</p>\n<p>The Lobby is written in C# and has some issues building on Mono, but there are simple workarounds.</p>\n<h2>Quick Fixes</h2>\n<p><code>zero-k/other/.nugut/NuGet.targets</code> line 54:</p>\n<pre><code>  $(NuGetCommand) install \"$(PackagesConfig)\" -source \"$(PackageSources)\"  $(NonInteractiveSwitch) $(RequireConsentSwitch) -solutionDir \"$(SolutionDir) \"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Should instead be</p>\n<pre><code>  $(NuGetCommand) install \"$(PackagesConfig)\" -source \"$(PackageSources)\"  $(NonInteractiveSwitch) $(RequireConsentSwitch) -solutionDir \"$(SolutionDir)\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thereby removing the space after <code>$(SolutionDir)</code>. This was causing packages to be downloaded to <code>zero-k/other/ /packages</code> instead of <code>zero-k/other/packages</code>.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, it should fail due to case sensitive file resolution on Linux. The solution is to disable case sensitivity with Mono builds:</p>\n<pre><code>  export MONO_IOMAP=all\n</code></pre>\n<p>Volla! The ZeroK Lobby should have successfully compiled to a binary.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}

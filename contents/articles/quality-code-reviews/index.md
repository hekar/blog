title: "Quality Code Reviews"

Lately I have been wondering why our team has been so effective with code reviews, until
an old friend of mine sent me a link to a video on doing [effective code reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjmw9TRB7s).

Without realising it, we had been following a series of implicit rules that the
team had devised through practice and solidified through habit.

While these rules aren't set in stone and are more akin to guideline or principles,
we have come to focus on the following:
* Time to save other's time, by reviewing your own code first
* Do not be on the offensive or defensive
* Ask questions
* Avoid the condescending "why didn't you _just_ \_\_\_\_?"
* Try to add references (ie. external documentation, studies, etc)

Part of this is because we have been following the ideas found in the video
titled [Does a developer need to be nice?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9OpTNk0hYc) by [Mattias P Johansson](https://twitter.com/mpjme) on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). In the video, he refers to a study
performed by [Google](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) on how to build great teams. They found the key to a great
team is not whether it has good or great developers. Instead it is more important that the team has a factor of psychological safety. To quote the [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html):


> Psychological safety is "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up," Edmondson wrote in a study [...]. "It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves."

The purpose of the team is
to execute on and release great products for the customer. To produce value.
Not to engage in unproductive and sometimes downright destructive office politics. Since many software developers are introverted this becomes even more important, because they are more easily effected than other members of an organization.

Therefore, the team should have a culture of being "nice". Having an "all star", "superstar" or "rockstar" (all overused terms) cast of developers becomes secondary.

Of course, this does not mean individuals need not be talented and willing to learn, both at work and
during their time outside of work. There is a degree of skill and grit required to produce the quality of software demanded by today's consumers. But code reviews and being generally pleasurable are
key assets. They contribute to quality just as much as and if not more, than practice with open source, side projects, puzzles, code katas,
etc. are to technical abilities. Every developer has his or her own method
of practicing their technical skills, but many fall into neglecting their soft skills.
Soft skills which are essential to making or breaking great teams. And ultimately making or breaking great companies.

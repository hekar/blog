Keeping focus as a software developer is paramount to one's personal and
career development. Software development requires containing an incredible
amount of state in memory. Much of this memory is short term and can easily
be wiped by en interruption. This is why it is paramount that a software developer
avoid interuptions that are within their control. Otherwise the primary
mechanism, learning by doing will become a difficult avenue.

Having struggled with this issue recently, I began to experient and came
across the pomodoro technique. The beauty of this technique is that you can
hold yourself accountable for the tasks that you do not necessarily want to do.
This is a prerequisite for many roles in software development and entrepreneurship.

There are also numerous benefits:
* Staying on track
* Relieving stress
* Self accountability
* Reducing work hours by increasing effectiveness (or simply increasing the amount you can do in one day)
* Feeling of responsibility

As I've been getting older, I've been finding myself paying more attention to
time. Time is something that many of us take for granted, but it's worth more
than anything else we possess. Yet we seem to waste time.

In an effort to be more effective with my use of time, I have begun
experimenting with the Pomodoro time management technique.

The Pomodoro time management technique is well known, but quite simply
summed up as breaking work down into 25 minute intervals, followed by shorter
breaks. Normally, the breaks are 5 - 15 minutes, depending on the individual.

The goal behind the technique is to improve one's focus on work, while avoiding
distracts and reducing stress. This is done through allowing one to schedule


Knowing what to do before you sit at your desk is essential. I cannot explain
why, but it seems like whatever you start doing when you unlock the computer
sets the tone for the next 15 - 30 minutes. If you decide to open up Reddit,
Facebook or Youtube, you will quickly find that 45 minutes later you have
accomplished nothing and have come out worse than before. This can become
an addiction that you fundamentally believe you need in your life. Excuses
include being "tired" after work or needing to "unwind".

In a notebook, I keep a daily updated list of TODOs. Each TODO item has
a number of pomodoros.

For example:
  "Write Pomodoro blog post in rough draft - 3 Pomodoro"

"3 Pomodoro" equates to 25 * 3 == 75 minutes.

After completing the task I will check off the items as completed. The idea is
keep TODO items at 3 Pomodoros or less. This works for the workplace, because
our tasks are tracked Rally. IT is not essential for me to keep a weekly
schedule of tasks. Outlook and planning software already exist for these purposes.

After work hours is a separate story. It is necessary to schedule my week
in advance. Personally, I use Trello, but other pieces of software also
suffice.

While at work interruptions make pomodoro time tracking difficult. At home it
can be easier to focus. This is particularly due to the fact that I usually only
schedule 6 pomodoros of tasks outside of work each day.

Pomodoro can combat distraction, reduce stress and increase effectiveness.
Set a schedule and stick with it. Just as developers use tools for completing
technical tasks, they can do the same to improve their productivity.

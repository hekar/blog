I'd been wondering why our team had been so effective with code reviews, until
an old friend of mine sent me a link to a video on doing [effective code reviews]().

Without realising it, we had been following a series of implicit rules that the
team had devised through practice.

While these rules aren't set in stone and are more akin to guideline or principles,
we have come to focus on the following:
* Do not be on the offensive
* Ask questions
* Avoid "why didn't you _just_" or "___"

Part of this is because we have been following the ideas found in the video
by []() at [funfunfunction]() on [](). In the video, []() to refers to a study
performed by Google on how to build great teams. They found the key to a great
team is not whether it has good or great developers. Even more important than
exceptional talent was a factor psychological safety. The purpose of the team is
to execute on and release great products for the customer. To produce value.
Not to engage in unproductive and sometimes downright destructive office politics.

The team should have a culture of being "nice".

Your team does not have to comprised of an "all star", "superstar" cast of
developers to be highly effectively.

Of course, individuals must be talented and willing to learn, both at work and
during their time outside of work. Code reviews and being pleasurable are
key assets. Just as practice is with open source, side projects, puzzles, code katas,
etc. are to technical abilities. Every developer has his or her own method
of practicing their technical skills, but we must not forget the soft skills.
They can make or break great teams. They can make or break entire companies.

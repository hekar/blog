## Summary
 - Have goals for your career and life. Douglas said this was one of the most important things that happened in his life.
 - "I'm going to do something meaningful and contribute to society. The complexity of the problems we face are growing really fast". Humans are getting farther and farther behind in coping with complexity and urgency
 - Douglas wanted to change the world and produce something beneficial to mankind. He realised that computers could help the world. With his knowledge of electronics, he realised that screens could be used just the same as punch cards could be used.
 - Douglas had sketched the idea of a mouse and once they had created a computer display, they decided to build the mouse
  - "Someone started calling it a mouse. No one knows [who it was]"
  - The mouse had three buttons, because they realised that the human hand was capable of using three buttons
 - The computer display was built from scratch. It was based on characters, rather than pixels. The physical dimensions of the electronics he details are astounding. The display driver circuitry for rendering characters consumed more space than 6 - 7 desktop machines. The display cost over $90,000 in 1960s dollars.
 - The computer had copy, paste, delete words, etc. It resembles Vim quite a bit. Verbs and nouns for interacting on text. It would use the mouse and keyboard. cw (copy word), followed by clicking on the word.
 - Douglas believed it'd be difficult to spread knowledge of this system through papers and publications. He believed the best way to spread the ideas he had worked on would be to create a demo. He details how they created the video conferencing and recording system.
  - He wrote a script for the demo
  - There was an audience of about 1000 individuals that watched the demo. Many of them were accomplished computer scientists.
  - Almost every scene was based on hyperlinks
  - Douglas felt so "lucky that [they] got through the demo without crashing"
 - Douglas thinks the focus needs to be capabilities that can be derived from computers
  - He thinks that computers don't need to be so easy to learn
  - "If we applied the same concept to bicycles we'd all be riding tricycles"
  - Doug found that businesses wanted to use computers for office automated. They believed the real user would be secretaries and therefore computers should be easy to learn
  - Doug kept trying to point out that he believed the real users would be tomorrow's knowledge workers, but it didn't gain much traction

## Ideas
 - Elevators changed the world by allowing people to build higher buildings
 - Douglas was sure that every knowledge worker in the future would be working this way (with a mouse, keyboard and graphical user interface)
 - The skills required to put everything together required extensive knowledge of many domains: chemistry, physics, mathematics, electronics, computers, etc
